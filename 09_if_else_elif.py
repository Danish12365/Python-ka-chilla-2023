# extra examples fro my side by using chat GPT

# if Statement:The if statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code when a specified condition is True.

# x = 10

# if x > 5:
#     print("x is greater than 5")


# #if and else Statements:The else statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed 
# # when the condition of the if statement is False.

# y = 3

# if y > 5:
#     print("y is greater than 5")
# else:
#     print("y is not greater than 5")



# # if, elif, and else Statements:he elif statement allows you to check multiple conditions in a sequence.
# #  It is used when you have more than two possible outcomes.

# z = 7

# if z > 10:
#     print("z is greater than 10")
# elif z > 5:
#     print("z is greater than 5 but not greater than 10")
# else:
#     print("z is 5 or less")



    




# Nested if Statements:You can also nest if statements within other if statements to create more complex decision structures.


# a = 12

# if a > 5:
#     print("a is greater than 5")
    
#     if a > 10:
#         print("a is also greater than 10")
#     else:
#         print("a is not greater than 10")
# else:
#     print("a is 5 or less")
