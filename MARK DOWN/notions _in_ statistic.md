# Statistics - Notations

Following table shows the usage of various symbols used in Statistics

# Capitalization

## Generally lower case letters represent the sample attributes and capital case letters are used to represent population attributes.

p- sample proportion.

X- set of population elements.

x- set of sample elements.

N- set of population size.

N- set of sample size.

# Greek Vs Roman letters

## Roman letters represent the sample attributs and greek letters are used to represent Population attributes.

μ- population mean.

x¯- sample mean.

δ- standard deviation of a population.

s- standard deviation of a sample.

# Population specific Parameters

## Following symbols represent population specific attributes.

μ- population mean.

δ- standard deviation of a population.

μ2- variance of a population.

P- proportion of population elements having a particular attribute.

Q- proportion of population elements having no particular attribute.

ρ- population correlation coefficient based on all of the elements from a population.

N- number of elements in a population.

# Sample specific Parameters

## Following symbols represent population specific attributes.

b1- regression coefficient in a sample regression line.

sb1- standard error of the slope of a regression line.

# Probability
P(A)- probability that event A will occur.

P(A|B)- conditional probability that event A occurs, given that event B has occurred.

P(A′)- probability of the complement of event A.

P(A∩B)- probability of the intersection of events A and B.

nCr- number of combinations of n things taken r at a time.

# Set

A⋒B- intersection of set A and B.

A⋓B- union of set A and B.

{A,B,C}- set of elements consisting of A, B, and C.

# Summation Symbols

∑- summation symbol, used to compute sums over a range of values.

∑x or ∑xi- sum of a set of n observations. Thus, ∑x=x1+x2+...+xn.
