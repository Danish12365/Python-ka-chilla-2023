    "\n",
    "The list you provided appears to contain various meteorological variables. Here's an explanation of each variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **p (mbar)**: Atmospheric pressure in millibars (mbar). Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of air above a given point in the atmosphere and is typically measured in millibars or hectopascals (hPa).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **T (degC)**: Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). It represents the measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tpot (K)**: Potential temperature in Kelvin (K). Potential temperature is the temperature a parcel of dry air would have if it were brought adiabatically (without transfer of heat) to a standard reference pressure level (usually 1000 hPa).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tdew (degC)**: Dew point temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated with water vapor and condensation begins to occur. It is a measure of atmospheric humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **rh (%)**: Relative humidity as a percentage (%). Relative humidity is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in the air to the saturation vapor pressure at a given temperature, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **VPmax (mbar)**: Saturation vapor pressure in millibars (mbar). It represents the maximum amount of water vapor that can exist in the air at a given temperature. It is also known as the saturation vapor pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **VPact (mbar)**: Actual vapor pressure in millibars (mbar). It represents the pressure exerted by water vapor molecules in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **VPdef (mbar)**: Vapor pressure deficit in millibars (mbar). It is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure and the actual vapor pressure at a given temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **sh (g/kg)**: Specific humidity in grams per kilogram (g/kg). Specific humidity is the mass of water vapor present in a unit mass of air.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **H2OC (mmol/mol)**: Water vapor concentration in millimoles per mole (mmol/mol). It represents the concentration of water vapor molecules in the air relative to the total number of air molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **rho (g/m^3)**: Air density in grams per cubic meter (g/m^3). Air density is the mass of air per unit volume and is influenced by temperature, pressure, and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **wv (m/s)**: Wind velocity in meters per second (m/s). It represents the speed at which air is moving horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **max. wv (m/s)**: Maximum wind velocity in meters per second (m/s). It represents the maximum speed of horizontal air movement observed during a specific period.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **wd (deg)**: Wind direction in degrees (°). It represents the direction from which the wind is blowing, measured clockwise from true north.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are commonly used in meteorology to characterize the state of the atmosphere and are essential for weather forecasting, climate studies, and various other applications."
